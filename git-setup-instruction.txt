Step 01: 
  Check SSH exists or not.
    ==> ls -a -l ~/.ssh

Step 02:
  Now generate the SSH key from the terminal.
    ==> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@domain.com"
      Tip: It will ask you few questions skip them if they are not really important for you, and give file name must.
      Example: (sumit-deqode-mac)

Step 03: 
  Now check agent running or not.
    ==> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Step 04:
  Add SSH key with newly created file.
    ==> ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Note: In my case file name is (sumit-deqode-mac), so command will be ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/sumit-deqode-mac

Warning: If above command not work for you try below one.
  ==> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  In this command file name should be (sumit-deqode-mac) in mine case.

Step 05: 
  Now push the code if it ask for username and password means configuration setup not proper.
  So now follow below step(s).

Step 06:
  Check the remote
    ==> git remote -v 
  Now remove the existing
    ==> git remote remove origin 
  Add new one which repo you want to be
    ==> git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
    So in my case it is (git remote add origin git@github.com:syadav-deqode/test-git.git)
